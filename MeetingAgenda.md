1. Define Site Goals
2. Define User Experience

##### Define Site Goals

Sounds obvious, but there are many websites that are created without a set of goals in mind. If you don't know what you want, certainly once the website is built it will not be what you want. One must know what they are trying to achieve when building a website.

Defining site goals in a business setting helps the customer feel involved with the process. Group consensus is important. First step is to determine the key players, the people that have to buy in to your ideas. Make them feel like they are contributing, listen to what they have to say.

Defining goals can be formal or informal, it depends on customer requirements and project scale. Informal would be going around with a notepad and asking questions, circling back around if you need anyone's approval or sign off. Formal would be a series of meetings where goals are defined.

Whether formal or informal, the steps to complete are the same:

###### Ask questions
- What is the mission or purpose of the org?
  - Often a mission statement and client literature helps give a grasp on the companies goals and values which you want to integrate into the website
- What are the short-term and long-term goals of the site?
  - Every person spoken to will have a different idea about the goals of the site. Some people might not be thinking long term and have an immediate need to get the site up.
  - Thinking long term saves headaches in design
- Who are the intended audiences?
  - Most clients don't think about their audiences
- Why will people come to your site?
  - What are you selling, what service is unique, why would they come, why would they come back?

###### Filter Answers
1. Separate intended audience questions out of the mix
2. Rephrase questions as goals, put those into a list, and group into categories if necessary
3. Rank each goal's importance. If goals are grouped in categories, rank each category.
4. Distill a master list of most important goals
5. Publish the goals, these are the first chapter of the design document.  

#### Defining the User Experience
Now that goals have been completed, we need to determine the audience. There is a common conception that the audience for a website is defined by the technology they use to access the site. A complete audience definition consists of the set of users with their goals and objectives. Stories help to visualize how a website will be used by an audience.

###### Define the audience
Take the list of audience questions, use it as a basis for your audience list and think of as many other audiences as possible. Break the list into categories if it gets too long.

Rank the importance of each audience.

Write down the goals for each audience on the list.

Compile the results

###### Create Stories
Stories tell the tale of the users interacting with your site.

Write 3-6 stores for each audience profile, the more important the more stories should go with it.

This may seem hard because the website isn't built yet, but imagine how a user would interact with a finished site and what experience you would like them to have. These will serve as a base line for when the site is complete as to how on track you are.

Story creation aspects:
  - Bring the user to life, give them a name, a background, and a task to accomplish on the site
  - Write the scenario for how they will interact and be as creative as possible
  - Can be time consuming, but a fun exercise
